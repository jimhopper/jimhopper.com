In the summer of 2017, I was asked to write scripts, brainstorm graphics, and help edit two videos on recovered memories for the Facebook page of [The Keepers](https://www.facebook.com/thekeepers/), a&nbsp;*Netflix* documentary.

It's a remarkable and inspiring documentary on several interwoven stories, including a priest's brutal sexual abuse of high school; the apparently related murder of a young nun, which was never adequately investigated by police, the Church, or anyone else, until 40 years later when two of the nun's early 1970s students devoted themselves full-time to finding justice for their beloved teacher; and one of the priest's victims, who recovered memories of his abuse in the 1990s.

Of course no 2-minute videos can do justice to the complexities of "how memory works" and how people come to lose access to memories and "recovered" them years or even decades later. But I believe these videos reflect the relevant memory and neuroscience research, and decades of clinical experience, supporting this description of the process: Soon after the abuse (or other traumatic event), there is a period of intentional suppression, which is followed eventually by habitual lack of retrieval, even if one encounters "retrieval cues" that we'd think would trigger recall, until eventually one encounters, as I say, "just the right cues, in just the right context, to make just the right (brain) connections, to finally retrieve pieces traumatic memory into awareness."

If you've experienced recovered memories, see if these videos fit with your experience, or not, and feel free to let me know.

The videos are best watched in order, because the first lays out key principles that are applied in the second. (Click the sound icon to hear my narration.)
