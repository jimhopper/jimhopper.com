In the summer of 2017, I was asked to write the scripts, brainstorm graphics, and offering editing input for videos on recovered memories for the Facebook page of [The Keepers](https://www.facebook.com/thekeepers/), an excellent and powerful *Netflix* documentary.

It's a remarkable and inspiring documentary of several interwoven stories, including a priest's brutal sexual abuse of high school; the apparently related murder of a young nun, which was never adequately investigated by police, the Church, or anyone else, until 40 years later when two of the nun's early 1970s students devoted themselves full-time to finding justice for their beloved teacher; and one of the priest's victims, who recovered memories of his abuse in the 1990s.

The 2-minute videos embedded below are meant to be watched in order, as the first lays out key principles applied in the second. (Click the sound icon to hear, not just see, my narration.)
